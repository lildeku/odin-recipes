        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fugu Fish</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Peel the fish skin carefully by forming a cut around the mouth. This fish has no scales.
                </li>
                <li>Using salt, thoroughly and delicately wash the fish and remove the eyes during the process.
                </li>
                <li>Gut the fish using a sharp knife. Its extremely important to be extra careful around the liver and the ovary region. A slight cut will make the poison escape out of the fish. 
                </li>
                <li>On a clean board, cut along the bone and form rectangular slices.
                </li>
                <li>To prepare stew, cut the head into pieces and boil.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
